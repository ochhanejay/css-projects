-   JavaScript is a light weight, interpreted, just in time (JIT) compiled programming language.

-   JavaScript support several programming approches, it is a proto type based single threaded dynamic
    language that supports functional programming, structional programming, object
    oriented programming etc.

- JavaScript is used

    Client Side     with        HTML
    Server Side     with        NodeJs
    Database        with        MongoDB

                    Evulution of JavaScript

- Internet started with a browser called "Mosaic" and  scripting language called "ECMA Script"
    [Europen Computer Manufactures association]
-   GML & SGML
-   1990 Tim Berners Lee introduced Web & HTML

-   1994 Netscape Communications developed a browser called "Netscape Cummunicator"
        Netscape    -   Markup  -   HTML
                        Script  -   ECMA Script

-   1996 Netscape appointed a scripting expert to design a client side script for thier
    browser. [Netscape Communicator]
    His name is "Brendan Eich"
    He developed a script and named it as "Mocha" which was later named as "LiveScript"

-   1996-1997 Netscape given responsiblity of maintaining the "LiveScript" to a company
    called "Sun MicroSystem" [Java]
-   SunMicrosystem - Re-named LiveScript as
    "JavaScript"

---------------------------------------------------
-   JavaScript is a language that follows the standards of ECMA.
-   JavaScript versions are named as ECMAScript
-   JavaScript version ES5, ES6, ES8[2018]....ES12.
-   JavaScript is used with HTML to manipulate DOM.
    [HTML present DOM   -      Java manipulate DOM]
-   JavaScript is used for client side validations and handling interactions.
==============================================================
JavaScript Drawbacks
-   It is not stricly typed and not strongly typed.
    not stricly typed: not follow the rules, voilate the rules
    not strongly typed: variables

-   Browser Compatiblity issues

-   Not secured.
-   JavaScript can be disabled in browser
===============================================================
-   In web technologies if validations and interactions are handled at server side
    then it increases burdon on server.
===============================================================

    How do we know JavaScript enabled or not in a browser?

-   You can use HTML element <noscript>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>JavaScript </title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Testing JavaScript</h2>
    <noscript>Please Enable JavaScript</noscript>    
</body>
</html>

========================================================
1)  JavaScript can be used in HTML page
    a) inline
    b) Embeded
    c) External File

A)  inline
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>JavaScript </title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Testing JavaScript</h2>
    <button onclick="window.print()">Print</button>
</body>
</html>

----------
you can't reuse it on another button click.
======================================================
B) Embeded: In this method the JavaScript functions are defined within the page
    by using <script> element. So that you can access and re-use the functions.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>JavaScript </title>
    <script>
        function Printing(){
            window.print();
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Testing JavaScript</h2>
    <button onclick="Printing()">Print</button>
    <button onclick="Printing()">Print2</button>
</body>
</html>
===============================================================
C) External File:   extension .js
